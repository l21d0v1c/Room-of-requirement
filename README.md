Welcome to the "Room of requirement".
Write a "Thing" and a "Magic word", then click on "Evoke" to enter.
Click on "Load a thing" to upload a secret file, then click on "Quit the room" to leave the room.
You or another wizard will be able to retrieve the object — if they have the correct "Thing" and "Magic word" — by clicking again on "Evoke", then on "Load the thing".
Once the "Thing" is downloaded, all traces of your presence will be erased within two days, as if you had never come, never written anything, and never downloaded anything.
Your mischief will be managed.
